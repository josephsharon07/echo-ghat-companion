# Introduction

Mountainous ghat roads present **significant safety challenges** due to **sharp hairpin bends**, **limited visibility**, and **lack of cellular connectivity**. These conditions contribute to higher accident rates and make emergency assistance difficult to access. Traditional safety measures provide only passive protection in these unique environments.

The **EchoGhat Road Safety Project** addresses these issues through a **LoRa-based communication system** designed specifically for mountainous terrain. This system creates a **vehicle-to-vehicle network** that functions without cellular infrastructure, allowing vehicles to exchange **critical safety information** including location, speed, and proximity. Drivers receive **real-time warnings** about oncoming vehicles around blind corners or on narrow roads.

The solution combines an **ESP32-LoRa hardware gateway** with a **Next.js web application** and **Android mobile app** to provide **interactive mapping** and **voice alerts**. By enhancing situational awareness, EchoGhat aims to **reduce accident rates** on mountain roads while functioning independently of traditional communication infrastructure.
