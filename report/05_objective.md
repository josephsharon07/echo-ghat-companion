# OBJECTIVE

The **primary objective** of the EchoGhat Road Safety Project is to **enhance road safety in mountainous ghat regions** through an infrastructure-independent communication system.

## Key Objectives

1. **Develop a LoRa-based vehicle communication system** with 2+ kilometer range in mountainous terrain.

2. **Create ESP32-LoRa hardware gateways** that operate independently of cellular networks.

3. **Implement advanced algorithms** for reliable heading calculation, speed estimation, and hazard detection.

4. **Design offline-capable maps** with voice alerts to minimize driver distraction.

5. **Enable real-time warning system** for approaching vehicles, blind spots, and hairpin bends.

6. **Optimize power consumption** through efficient hardware design and sleep modes.

7. **Validate system effectiveness** through field testing in actual ghat road conditions.
