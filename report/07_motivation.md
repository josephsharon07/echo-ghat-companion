# MOTIVATION

The EchoGhat Road Safety Project is motivated by the **alarming accident rates** on India's mountainous ghat roads, which are **3-5 times higher** than equivalent plains highways. The **unique challenges** of blind corners and narrow passes, combined with **poor communication infrastructure**, create dangerous situations for drivers. Personal interviews with regular ghat road travelers revealed **constant anxiety** when navigating these routes, often employing imperfect defensive tactics like stopping at every turn. The **technological gap** in existing safety solutions, which typically require cellular connectivity, presented an opportunity to create an **innovative, infrastructure-independent system**. By leveraging LoRa technology and modern microcontrollers, we aim to develop an **affordable solution** that can make a meaningful impact on road safety and ultimately **save lives**.
